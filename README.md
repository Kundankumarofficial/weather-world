WEATHER WORLD
-------------

A basic client-side weather app example. Uses the [Open Weather Map API](http://openweathermap.org/api) to request weather data.

###Workshop
Idea - Let's make a super simple weather appplication that runs on the web. You type in the name of a city and get the current temperature for that city. 

To make this application, we're going to need to cover the following topics:
  * HTML - the information represented on the page
  * CSS - the style or look of the information
  * Javacsript - the programming language needed to add the necessary behavior (or interaction) to the webpage
  * API (Application Programming Interface) - where and how we get the weather data
  * JSON - the weather data
